abstract: "Firms possess control over key determinants of workers' earnings :
  wages, hours worked, and employment stability. As workers would rather all
  three remain stable over the business cycle, firms face a choice as to how to
  insure their workers. Empirically, firms at the bottom of the wage ladder are
  found to insure workers through wages, while the top - through stable hours
  and employment. We suggest a higher level of labor replaceability at the
  bottom of the ladder as the driving cause of this heterogeneity and argue for
  it using a dynamic contracting framework with a promised value constraint
  imbedded into a directed search model."
