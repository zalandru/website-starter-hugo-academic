abstract: "Firms hire workers from different pools. Some firms hire more
  unemployed workers than others, making their demand for labor more important
  for unemployment. I differentiate jobs based on their hiring pool and estimate
  their wage cyclicality. The key finding is that wages in jobs hiring from
  unemployment are half as cyclical as wages in other jobs, for both incumbent
  workers and new hires. To measure the effects of this on unemployment
  volatility, I develop a labor search model with partial separation of search
  and heterogeneous wage rigidity and show that accounting for this
  heterogeneity increases the volatility of unemployment by 14%-34%."
